Parallel Delete Virtual Machines Extensions.


Extensions are used widely in Azure for things such as:


- Antimalware


- DependencyAgent


- Script Extension


- DSC Extension


- OMS / Monitoring Extension

- Backup Extension


If there is an error on the extension or you need to remove it for some reason, this script can help and remove the extension, in parallel.


 

 

        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
